# A low level example program 

## Example scenario
The scenario is making a user-space application that controls some hardware through a driver  
This driver provides a header which contains various #DEFINEs and function prototypes  
The driver also provides documentation on how to communicate with the hardware  
The task was to make a user-space application that reads instructions from a file and executes those instructions on the hardware
